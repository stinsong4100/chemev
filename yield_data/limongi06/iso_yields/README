Each file contains the isotopic chemical structure of the star after the
explosion, down to a mass coordinate of the order of 1Msun. All the unstable
isotopes are fully decayed into their closest stable daughter nucleus. The
meaning of each column should be auto explicative because there is a legend in
the first row. The first two columns contain the mass coordinate in solar masses
and the radius in cm. The first row below the legend contains the average
chemical composition of the mass lost by the wind while the amount of mass lost
by the wind is simply the mass difference between the surface point (i.e. the
first one) and the second one.
