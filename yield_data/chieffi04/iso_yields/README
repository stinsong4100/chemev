Each row contains the yields integrated (in Msun) from the surface up to that
specific mass layer. All the unstable nuclei are fully decayed to their stable
daughter in advance. For each mass there are 12 files, 11 from zxxmxx.q10 to
zxxmxx.q20 and a file called zxxmxx.nik. The legenda of the various columns is
in the first row of each file. For convenience each file has the mass (in Msun)
in the first column. The .nik file contain the cumulative abundance (in solar
masses) of the Ni56 so that it is easy to find the mass cut corresponding to
each specific amount of Ni56 ejected outward. The meaning of the filenames is as
follows: Zxx refers the metallicity: z13=0.001, z63=0.006 and so on. Mxx refers
to the star mass in solar masses.
