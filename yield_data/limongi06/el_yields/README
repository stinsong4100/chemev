Each file consists of 44 columns whose legenda is the following:
Mass H He Li Be B C N O F Ne Na Mg Al Si P S Cl Ar K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni
Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Rb Sr Y Zr Nb Mo 56Ni

For each mass cut shown in column 1, columns 2 to 43 contain the yields of the
various elements (in solar masses). The last column also provide the amount of
56Ni that would be ejected with that specific choice of the mass cut. We prefer
to give yields for a variety of possible mass cut because the determination of
this quantity is still so uncertain that there is definitely room for different
alternatives. We leave such a responsability to the user.
