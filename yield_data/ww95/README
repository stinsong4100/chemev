The ascii data file maltov1.orig contains the isotopic contributions from

    * Type II supernovae (Woosley & Weaver 1995 models),
    * low mass stars (Renzini & Voli 1986 models),
    * six different Type Ia supernovae models (Chandra, Sub-Chandra, & NSE;
	Timmies et al. 1995: ``The popular W7 model of Nomoto, Thielemann, &
	Yokoi 1984 was adopted as representative of Type Ia supernovae, but the
	detailed nucleosythesis was taken from Thielemann, Nomoto, & Yokoi
	1986.''),
    * three different classical novae flavors (1.0, 1.25, and 1.35 Msol models),
    * Big Bang.
